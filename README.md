# YELPwebscraper

The python script uses lxml and json python libararies to parse throught the YELP website to scrape the data about the businesses registered on YELP in New York (can be customized to work with any city). All types of businesses are taken into account and scraped automatically.

Finally all the scraped data is collected and concatenated using pandas.concat from python pandas libarary and the resulatnt dataframe is converted to a csv file which now contains all the required information.
